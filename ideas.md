### General idea
- Group up all the terms with the same degree
- Discover the polynomial degree
- Build the reduced form
- If the polynomial degree is 2:
-- Build basic the fiendish quadratic equation
-- Check the polarity of the discriminant
- Calculate all

- Confirm the result subing the result in the original equation
